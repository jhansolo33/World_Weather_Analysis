# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview and Purpose of the Project:

Taking the PlanMyTrip app, our company incorporates advanced technology to make a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, by incorporating a weather description to the weather data. Followed by using the beta testers for input statements to filter the data for the participants weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, after generating a list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester filters out four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, utilizing Geoapify and it's Geoapify routing API, a travel route between the four cities is generated as well as an additional map.
